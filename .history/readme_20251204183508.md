# Customer Churn Prediction ML Pipeline

An end-to-end machine learning system for predicting customer churn, built with production-ready practices including data pipelines, model training, REST API, and monitoring.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
- Data engineering and ETL pipeline development
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- REST API for real-time predictions
- Performance optimization and monitoring
- Docker containerization for deployment

## Tech Stack

- **ML/Data:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **API:** FastAPI, Pydantic
- **Deployment:** Docker
- **Testing:** Pytest

## Current Status

🚧 **Week 1:** Setting up infrastructure and data pipeline
